	Abstract = {A new algorithm is presented for the fast computation of the Discrete Fourier Transform. This algorithm belongs to that class of recently proposed 2 n -FFT's which present the same arithmetic complexity (the lowest among any previously published one). Moreover, this algorithm has the advantage of being performed "in-place", by repetitive use of a "butterfly"- type structure, without any data reordering inside the algorithm. Furthermore, it can easily be applied to real and real symmetric data with reduced arithmetic complexity by removing all redundancy in the algorithm.},
